I learn what is a VCS, types of it, reasons why to choose git.

I also learned how to work with git, what is a branch and the git flow.

I learned git best practices and commands used for diiferent options.

In the end I learned how to resolve conflicts (or merge conflicts).

Challenges - creating a gitignore file for the first time.
I learned the flow of github, the most important commands and how to handle some errors.
feedback: the homework was interactive, maybe some steps could have been described in more detail.
